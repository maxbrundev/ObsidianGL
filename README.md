# ObsidianGL
Real-time CPU software renderer with a modern API

A complete rewrite of [AmberGL](https://github.com/maxbrundev/Rasterizer) from scratch, designed to also provide an immediate mode capable of rendering Minecraft Classic 0.30 (OpenGL 1.1), for science.

*Amber preserves, Onyx structures, Obsidian cuts.*
