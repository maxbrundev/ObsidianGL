# ObsidianGL
Real-time SIMD-optimized CPU software renderer with a modern API

A complete rewrite of [AmberGL](https://github.com/maxbrundev/Rasterizer) from scratch, designed to also provide an immediate mode capable of rendering Minecraft Classic 0.30 (OpenGL 1.1), for science.

10,000 rotating cubes at ~60 FPS, constant, without tile-based rasterization  
*CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D*
